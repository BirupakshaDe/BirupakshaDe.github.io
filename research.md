  <h2>Gaia DR3 Clustering of Stellar Populations</h2>
  <p>
    Built a pipeline for cleaning, feature engineering, and unsupervised clustering
    (HDBSCAN/UMAP) to discover co-moving groups and associations.
  </p>

  <h2>Exoplanet Radial Velocities</h2>
  <p>
    Implemented basic RV modeling and periodogram analysis to recover known
    planetary signals from public datasets.
  </p>

  <h2>Orbital Dynamics Simulations</h2>
  <p>
    Wrote Python integrations (RK4, symplectic) to visualize Keplerian motion and
    study perturbations.
